To solve this problem, we'll need to find three wires to disconnect in order to divide the components into two separate groups, while maximizing the size difference between the two groups. Then, you'll multiply the sizes of these two groups together.

We sould first  break down the steps to tackle this problem:

Read and Parse Input: Start by parsing the input data, which consists of component connections. Each line represents a connection between components.
Build Graph: Construct a graph where each component is a node, and the connections between components represent edges. This will help visualize how components are connected.
Find Potential Wires to Disconnect: Identify potential wires to disconnect in order to divide the components into two separate groups. To do this, you'll need to explore different combinations of disconnecting wires.
Calculate Group Sizes: For each combination of disconnected wires, calculate the sizes of the resulting two groups.
Maximize Size Difference: Choose the combination of disconnected wires that maximizes the difference in sizes between the two groups.
Multiply Sizes: Multiply the sizes of the two groups obtained from the chosen combination of disconnected wires.
